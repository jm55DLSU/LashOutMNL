 Code repository for LashOutMNL booking website. 
 
 This project is part of a requirement for CSSWENG (A.Y. 2022-2023).

**About the client:**

Lash Out MNL Beauty Lounge is a beauty services parlor that operates at BF Homes Almanza, Las Pinas City, Philippines. It was founded by Ms. Nicole Suriaga in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The parlor offers services that specialize in lashes and eyebrows that their clients could customize according to their wants. While they specialize in lash and eyebrow services, they also offer nail care services. 

Since the business is initially solely managed and run by Ms. Suriaga herself, she implements a by-appointment method of business where customers must be able to schedule an appointment in order for Ms. Suriaga to allocate the necessary time, resources, and labor per customer on every business day that the business is operating which still applies to this day, with now having a total of 2/3 employees.

The business makes use of the latest ways of doing business such as using social media for promotion (through Facebook and Instagram), utilization of e-payment services instead of payment through cash, and use of online services for collecting booking appointments.
